Black Winged - Aurum Aerosearch

I'm a hard worker, and everything with me is, if I work hard, I should get paid for it. Everything with me, I try to symbolize something flashy like jewelry or a car. The rubbing hands is a symbol of hustling, so it goes back to the money.

Alike the notion that corvids, especially magpies, have a special affinity for shiny object has been roaming around more than a century. Under the watchful eye of this crow and its virtuous urge to rummage anything that illuminates on the ground. That's my anthropomorphism.
